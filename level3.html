			<h4>About Game</h4>
      <p>Hey Welcome to Rick and Morty Fan Craze Puzzle Slider. This game was created as one of many escape rooms to be apart of a giant collaboprative escape room for our externship's final project. This game was created and designed by Jaleel Bennett, Idris and Dante Ransom.</p>

			<h4> Help</h4>
      <p>The game begins with a main puzzle screen showing the scrambled images. Simply slide one or more puzzle pieces into the empty space to rearrange the pieces into the complete the puzzle. The user is provided with a single space at first. While playing, if you are lost trying to solve the puzzle you can get a hint of what the completed image  is. The next setting is the difficulty of the puzzle. TO begin the user chooses the difficulty level they would like to play at. The more rows and columns, the harder the puzzle will be to complete. This level has an image with a 3X3 grid</p>

			<h4>Hint </h4>
      <p>
        The solution of a 15-Puzzle is not so hard, it can easily be done intuitively. You only need to know a little trick when you reach the last two pieces of a layer.

        Let's say we have a 4x4 puzzle and we want to solve it starting with the tile marked with 1 in the upper left corner. Placing the first two pieces can't be a challenge, but you might need a little trick when you reach the last two pieces of the layer. Instead of positioning tile nr 3, then nr 4 we are going to solve these two together. Place 4 where 3 should be, 3 below it and move the empty slot next to 4. After that slide 4 to the right and move 3 up to the empty space as shown on the image. You can solve the second layer the same way.

        1	2	3	4
        5	6	7	8
        13	9	 	 
              
        The last two layers are
        solved together from left.
        When you reach the last two layers we need to use the same trick to solve the two tiles on the left corner: 9 and 13. After that comes the positioning of tiles nr 10 and 14 and you just have to rotate the remaining 3 tiles at the end to finish the puzzle.

        This solution method takes about 70 steps to solve a 4x4 puzzle from any random starting position. The same idea can be applied for the 8-puzzle too.
